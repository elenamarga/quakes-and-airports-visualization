Java project for "Object Oriented Programming in Java", course #1
in "Java Programming: Object-Oriented Design of Data Structures" 
from University of California, San Diego (on Coursera).
==================================================================
A skeleton to use Unfolding in Eclipse as well as some starter
code was provided.

The module folders contain the starter code for the programming assignments
associated with the MOOC.
In each file, a //TODO indicates the methods I implemented.

In week 6, the assignment consisted of a project extension and I chose to
work with the airport and route data, instead of quakes. 
- I decided to first sort the airports based on the number of in/out routes 
and then show only a certain number of airports. 
- When the user hovers over a marker, it desplays additional info about it, 
such as the name and the number of in/out routes. 
- When the user clicks on a marker, it desplays all the in/out routes of 
that airport.
